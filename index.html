        <p id="studyMethodOne">
            Bass used in this study were collected by boat electroshocking in the spring (2014 - 2021) 
            and fall of 2021. All fish at a particular site were collected on a single day. Fish were 
            held in aerated live wells until processed (less than two hours) and euthanized in 350 mg/L 
            Finquel (MS-222, tricaine methanosulfate, Argent Labs, Redmond, WA) following procedures 
            approved by the EESC- Leetown Research Laboratory #8217 Institutional Animal Care and Use 
            protocol.  Fish were weighed (gms), total length (from tip of snout to tips of caudal fin) 
            measured in mm, examined for visible abnormalities and a blood sample was obtained from the 
            caudal vessels using a sterile 3 ml syringe with a 23-gauge needle. Blood was placed into a 
            heparinized Vacutainer tube (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored on wet ice until 
            returned to the laboratory (2-4 hours). Blood was centrifuged at 1,000 x g at 4oC for 10 m 
            and plasma was aliquoted into cryovials and stored at -80 C.

            Plasma (0.5 ml) samples were shipped on dry ice to SGS AXYS Analytical Services Ltd., Sidney, 
            British Columbia, Canada. Thirteen perfluoroalkyl analytes were measured by the SGS AXYS Method 
            MLA-042: Analytical Procedure for the Analysis of Perfluoroalkyl Carboxylates and Sulfonates 
            and Perfluorooctane Sulfonamide in Blood Serum by LC-MS/MS. Samples were spiked with 
            isotopically labeled surrogate standards, extracted in formic acid, cleaned up on SPE 
            cartridges and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS or 
            UPLC-MS/MS). Final sample concentrations were determined by isotope dilution/internal standard 
            quantification against matrix matched calibration standards carried through the analysis 
            procedure alongside the samples. Results were reported directly in units of ng/mL in the 
            plasma sample. Detection limits were in the 0.5 - 1 ng/mL range for a 0.5 mL plasma sample. 
            Thirteen compounds were analyzed for but only those detected at least once are reported.

        <h2>Method, Tissue</h2>
        <p id="studyMethodThree">
            Tissue samples were analyzed by RTI Laboratories, Livonia, Michigan using DOD/DoE QSM 5.2 
            and 5.3; USEPA 1633 draft methods. Sample analyses included a method blank, LCs/L CSD, 
            MS/MSD, duplicates, post digestion spikes, serial dilutions, and all method quality controls. 
            Results were reported in ng/kg wet weight and converted to ng/g. Estimated concentrations 
            which were below the reporting limit but above the detection limit were used in the data 
            analyses. Concentrations below the detection limit were not used in site, temporal or tissue 
            comparisons. Twenty-eight compounds were analyzed for but only those which were detected at 
            least once are reported.
